                <p>Tian is a value-driven computer science student at MakeSchool. Tian was previously an auditor with an accounting degree <br>from the University of California, Santa Barbara<abbr>(UCSB)</abbr>. Throughout his time studying and working in the accounting industry,<br> Tian realized that he has several ideas that could solve frequent problems in his life and the lives of people around him.  Tian<br> was(and still is) excited to bring his ideas to life. However, he was not able to work on them due to a lack of coding skills and<br> working at a demanding day job.</p> 

                <p>After five months of working as an auditor, Tian decided that he would go back to school to pursue what he found could bring<br> meaning to his life - to create projects and platforms that can solve problems and reduce suffering in the world. Tian recently<br> just started as a junior at MakeSchool and is thrilled to work towards his potential. </p>
